# Tracking Objects by CamShift
 Implements real-time object tracking using the CamShift algorithm in OpenCV. Allowing us to manually select a Region of Interest (ROI), after which the system dynamically tracks the object based on its HSV color histogram. The bounding box adapts to the object's movement and shape changes in the live video (camera)
