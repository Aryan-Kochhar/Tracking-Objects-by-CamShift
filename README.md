# tracking objects by camshift  

implements real-time object tracking using the camshift algorithm in opencv. allowing us to manually select a region of interest (roi), after which the system dynamically tracks the object based on its hsv color histogram. the bounding box adapts to the object's movement and shape changes in the live video (camera).  

installation and usage :  

install the required dependencies -> pip install numpy opencv-python  

how it works :  

press 's' to select an object for tracking  
press 'q' to exit  

possible improvements  

trying to integrate ai-based object detection to remove manual roi selection which can improve tracking accuracy with deep learning models. adding support for multi-object tracking.  

this is a basic object tracking system using camshift. it works well for simple tracking tasks but struggles with occlusions and drastic lighting changes. future updates may include ai-based tracking for better robustness.
